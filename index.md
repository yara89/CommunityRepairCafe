# Community Repair Café

A Community Repair Café is a youth led local initiative with a vision of helping the community through repairs of broken or in some way dysfunctional electrical or electronic devices (or other household items) to reduce waste and the expense of getting a new one. Not only does it help fix important things that people rely on in their everyday lives, it creates a social space for people to get together.

### REPAIR IS BETTER THAN RECYCLING
Making our things last longer is both more efficient and more
cost-effective than mining them for raw materials.

### REPAIR SAVES YOU MONEY
Fixing things is often free, and usually cheaper than replacing
them. Doing the repair yourself saves you money.

### REPAIR TEACHES ENGINEERING
The best way to find put how something works is to take it apart.

### REPAIR SAVES THE PLANET
Earth has limited resources. Eventually we will run our.
The best way to be efficient is to reuse what we already have.
